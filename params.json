{"name":"Libilbc-rfc3951","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.linphone.org/libilbc-rfc3951.git","body":"This package downloads and builds the iLBC codec as published in IETF\r\nRFC 3951.\r\n\r\nBy default, the upstream package installs into /usr/local.  Please use\r\n'./configure --prefix' to change it.  If the package you are using was\r\nprepared for your distribution, your maintainer will have adjusted the\r\ninstall location for your system.\r\n\r\nBecause of potential licensing issues this package downloads the\r\nsources for the iLBC codec from IETF, extracts them using a script that\r\nis also downloaded and subsequently compiles them.\r\n\r\nSince one should be concerned about executing unknown scripts or code,\r\nthe downloaded files and the resulting extracted sources are checked\r\nagainst their known MD5 checksums.\r\n\r\nThis package also downloads the license and creates a pkg-config file\r\nfor easier use of the shared library.  They are not automatically\r\ninstalled by this upstream package but may have been included for\r\nyour system by the maintainer for your distribution.\r\n\r\nThe use of this codec is covered by a license that does not comply\r\nwith the standards for free software as established by the Debian\r\nFree Software Guidelines.\r\n\r\niLBC and Global IP Solutions are trademarks of Global IP Solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo compile on Windows using Visual Studio you need to install wget and awk from the GnuWin32 project and put them in your path. You can download them from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
